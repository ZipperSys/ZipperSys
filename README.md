## Hi there! 🖖😊


My name is Owen, better known as Zipper, I'm a Software Engineer from Washington. 🇺🇲

I basically work on whatever I find cool and interesting.

My main tech stack is Python, Bash, and C#. I'm currently trying to switch from VSCode to Neovim since I plan on moving over to [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) as my window manager in the near future.

I have a lot of projects that I've worked on but the ones I've had most fun on are the repos pinned below.

**Fun Facts**:
  - My favorite game is Marvel Rivals
  - I love zero sugar soda
  - My favorite superhero is Spider-Man
  - **Hobbies**: Magic the Gathering, anime, reading, video games, art
